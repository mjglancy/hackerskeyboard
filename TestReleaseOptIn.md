# Opting in to test releases #

Hacker's Keyboard now uses the Play Store alpha/beta testing features to distribute new prerelease versions.

If you wish to participate in testing these versions, please follow these steps:

  * Join the [Hacker's Keyboard ALPHA testers community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104370277048194083689) on Google+, or [hackerskeyboard](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hackerskeyboard) on googlegroups.com.
  * After joining the community or group, go to https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard to change your tester settings. The page describes the options available.

Once both steps are complete, it may take several hours until you start receiving updates.

Alternatively, alpha/beta versions are available for download in this shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6xf1Er-tUT7dVZFTE1xM0ZvSkE#list).
